# zathura-mod

My fork of Zathura with some customizations, built upon Debian's mainstream version.

# Customizations
1. Allow setting Zathura's appid using the environment variable ZATHURA_APPID.
2. Always start from page one.
3. Use the right button to move pages (instead of the middle button).
4. Try to fix the issue where multiple reloads cause a crash.
